more ancient due known as ‘ward penny’ (pp. 238-272).
This is succeeded hy a statement os what was due ior “view
ol lrankpledge'' from the vills in the various hundreds
(pp. 273-279); and this again by the amount oi Sheriff's
aid payable in each hundred (p. 280). The reason sor this
enumeration is set forth in the prologue to the Sixth Book,
which is worth translating (p. 238):

ln several hundreds the Prior ol Barnwell has lands and tenements,
services and homages, customs and villeins; but, as the servants ol the
Sherifi often distrain oi their own accord and unjustly, distraining
some whom they ought to pass over, and spanng others who ought ol
right to be distrained, in order to prevent the Prior or his tenants
being in the future oppressed unjustly by distraints oi this kind ior
suits in the courts ol the county or-the hundred, Sherifl’s aid or ward·
penny, it seemed useful to write down in this little work the names oi
the hundreda, the tenants, and the tenemento which ought to perform
services ol this sort, and have been in the habit oi periorming them
lrorn ancient days. And in future it will not be a man’s duty on
account oi such distraint to go to the Castle to inspect the Sheriil's
roll, but he may look into this book and gain his informationi irom it.

ln the Seventh Book we return to the Prior and
Convent ol Bamwell‚ and we find that it contains a lull
list os all their tenants Here again 1 will translate a
short passage from the prologue (p. 282):

As the Prior os Bamwell has some iree tenants and some villelm,
who owe himservices and customs, it appears useful to set down in
this little book the names oi all his tenants, their rents, their services,
the vill in which they live, their laws, and the places where they can
be distrained, according to what certain information can bediscovered
about these matters at this time, namely, in the year ol our Lord 1295,

and in the year since Simon de Ascellis became Prior the thirty
first.

The Eighth Book is wholly occupied witha Consue-
tudinarium, or Book ol Observances, ol the Augustinian
Order. As this book has been already edited, with a
translation and notes, by the editor ol this work¹, it has
been decided not to reprint it.
