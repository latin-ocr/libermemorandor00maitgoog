that rent had been divided between the Priories ol Caldwell‚
Kenilworth and Barnwell¹.

We come to awcll known dispute between the Priory
and the University(p. 95). The Chancellor brings‘an action
of annuity’against the Prior, and the Prior ha's to give way.
The question is settled by a ‘fine' levied before the justices
ln cyre at Cambridge. Fines, if they are at all long-and
this one is somewhat long—are not very easy instrumenta

It seems needless to repeat here what has elsewhere been

The story os some land at Comberton is introduced at
this point because it explains another rent, besides that

Henry III had begun rigorously to insist that his tenants
by sery‘eanty-who in the past have been, at least in name,
his menial servants-were not to alienate their holdings.
When an alienation had occurred, he held that in strictness
