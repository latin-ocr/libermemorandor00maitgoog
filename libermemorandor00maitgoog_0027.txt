afterwards passed to S. John’s College with ,its other ι
possessions; and the fine Norman dwelling-house which
bears the absurd name of School oi Pythagoras-part

of the property of the Scholars ol Medon, which their
founder took the precaution of buying in case they should
prefer Cambridge to Oxlord as a permanent place sor
study¹.

Before we leave the Great Bridge let us consider for
a moment the very interesting question of the number
of houses which the town contained in the thirteenth'
century; and especially the number to be assigned to the
district which we have just left, and which in the
Memoranda (p. 282) is styled “Beyond Bridge (Ultra
pontemt”

Domesday Book tells us that Grentebrige contained
400 houses divided into ten wards; that of those 400 houses
27 had been destroyed to make room for the castle; and
that two oi the ten wards had been thrown together. lt
has usually been the custom to assume that all these
houses and wards were transpontine; but this view has
been contested by Professor Maitland¹‚ who has made
a careful analysis of the Cambridge of the Hundred Rolls,
and shews thatin 1279 the whole town had only about 550
houses of which not more than 72 were allotted to the three
transpontine parishes ol S. Giles, S. Peter, and All Saints.
He states his view in the following brilliant passage:

l see the Grentebrige ol the Coniessot’s day as a very sparse
group of houses. 1 should not be surprised if it already reached as
far south as the King's Ditclr of later days, and if only two or three ol
its ten wards were transpontine. At this time a vill of 40 houses was
rather large than small. Cambridge bad 4⁰0· Take the house·
bedecked nucleus of an ordinary village and magnify it ten-fold; it
will cover a good space of ground. 1 would not suggest that the
nucleus of a borough was as loosely compacted as was the nucleus of

a common vill; but we must leave much room lor what we should call ’
farm buildings, for orcbards and little crofts ³.
