, He died, an old man, “in the thirty-eighth year of his

: office¹.¹' His death may therefore be placed in 1251.
Henry of Eye, tenth Prior, “in his third year ο1 office

placed his resignation in the hands of the official ol the see

ol Canterbury, duringa vacancy of the see of Ely².” The

vacancy here mentioned must be that which occurred after

’ the death of Hugh Northwold‚6 August, 1254, whose
. successor, William of Kilkenny, though elected, according

ξ to Bentham, “about the middle of October, 12 54⁸,'’ was not
consecrated until 15 August, 125 5. The see was therefore
without a Bishop for a lull year, and the Prior's resignation

³ may have taken place either at the end of 1254 or the

beginning of 1255.
The successor to Henry of Eye, Jolan of Thorley,
eleventh Prior, “ in the eleventh year of his tenure oi office

as Prior, resigned it into the hands of the Bishop of Ely⁴.”

Accordingly he was Prior from 1254 or 1255 to 1265 or

12663 and our chronology would be perfectly simple if we
had no other evidencethan this to deal with. But, among
the vexations which ruined his health was the outrage at
Wiggenhall ; and the rubric of the chapter in which that
L event is recorded (p. 119) runs as follows: De predacione
‚ de Wygmlralc anno regni regis H. .l2'j0.; that is to say it
ἶ is placed between 28 October, 1267, and 27 October, 1268,

³ or a year too late.

, Further, his successor Simon de Ascellis, who ought
‚ perhaps to be called Simon of Ashley‚ twelfth Prior,

l resigned 24 June, 1297⁵, having been Prior “for thirty years

and more (per tnginta annos et amplius),” a length of office

which places his accession in 1267, or in 1266, according to Ι

the sense we assign to the words etamplius. l am inclined
to think that the simplest way out of the difficulty is to
suppose that a wrong date has been inserted into the rubric
quoted above; and that for .lij⁰ we should read ‚ist—an
