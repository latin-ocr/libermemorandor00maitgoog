the road to St Neots, extending as sar as Bin Brook.

3. Little Field lay next to this, extending as sar as

name from a block oi twenty selions in Newnham‚ known
in the sourteenth century as the Carmedole².

Professor Maitland points out that “there was little
meadow in medieval Cambridge‚” and quotes William
Harrison‚ writing in 1 5 77, who says :

it hath no such stote oi medowe grounde as may suffice for the
ordinarie expencesos the towne and Vniuersitie, whereiore they are
intonet...to provide their haye froin other viliages about, which
minister the same unto them in verye great abundance³.

There was Long Green, which lay along the test bank
ot' the Cam, from the Mill Pool to the Great Bridge;
Sheeps Green; Coe Fen, or part of it; and Green Crost.
Between these two latter were Swine Croit‚ Parkers Piece,

and Christ’s Piece, but these were late additions. Parker’s ‹

Piece, sor instance, was not turned ‘stom tillage into sward’

until aiter it was acquired bythe town from Trinity College
in 1613.
