rights of the Hastingtots having somehow come to an end,
Gilbert Pecche obtains a grant of the whole rent of A 31 for
his life; but he dies in 1291. This story of the rent is
illustrated by entries that stand on the Pipe Rolls, and by
writs that issued from the Exchequer.

We pass to the fair in Barnwell which had been granted
to the Priory. lt soon gave rise to disputes between the
Canons and the Burgesses of Cambridge. For example,
who is entitled to the catalla fethnam-the chattels of people
who commit felony in the fair? The Canons, in spite of
what they regarded as a precedent in their favour-
a case which involved a pictoresque abjuration of the
realm (p. 89)—had to give way, fearing ‘to lose their
fair' by reason of an ‘abuse' of the franchise. So they
carne to terms with the townsfollr. So far as we know, the
townsfollr themselves had no chartered right to the catalkz
silanum before the reign of Richard 111. 1t is to be
remembered, however, that Barnwell and the scene of the
fair lay within the boundaries of the town (villa) of
Cambridge, and ‘the town' had been granted as a whole-
in some sense or another-to the burgesses. ,

Cambridge, like other towns of the same class, was
treated for one important purpose as though it were part of
the ancient demesne of the Crown. The King could tallage
it. Some documents are now given which set before us
a question of ‘double taxationf (pp. 91-2). The assessors
of the tallage first tax the Prior's tenants in Cambridge ac·
cording to their wealth in movables (per nurchandias suas),
and then proceed to tax the Prior on the rents that those
tenants pay him. He succeeds in asserting that this is not
equitable; but has to obtain writs to the sheriff in 1252,

The burgesses in a collective or corporate fashion owed
a rent to the Priory; not a large rent, only ten shillings
(p. 93). This was a fragment of arent of ,gro wherewith
the burgesses had compounded for ‘the third penny of the
borough' due of old time to the Earl. By various gifts
