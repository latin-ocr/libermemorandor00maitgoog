what that name might imply,' but that it was originally a
nick·narne, well or ill deserved, we can hardly doubt
The modern English form ol the name would probably be
Peachey.

The next record that we meet with comes from the
rolls os justices in eyre who visited Cambridge in ¹299
(p. 63)¹. The Prior is to answer to the King quo waranto
he claims certain ‘franchises ’-that is, royal rights-to wit,
view ol irankpledge and the amends lor breaches ol the
assize oi bread and beer in Chesterton and an annual sair
in Barnwell. He escapes easily, producing royal charters.
He is told that he may ‘go without day ¹—that is, he need
not come into Court again. But, as is usual in such cases,
there is a salvo lor the King’s right: in other words, the
King will not de estopped by this record frorn hereaiter
urging any right that he may have to recover these
franchises. .

When he is compiling his Second Book the writer looks
outside the ‘domus’ but thinks primarily of property that
lies close at hand. Specially he has to speak oi Chesterton.
Now Chesterton was part oi the ancient demesne os the
Crown. We begin with an extract from Domesday Book
which describes it as domim'ca villa Regis (p. 75). This
handsome manor passed into the hands os the Prior and
Canons. King John had granted them an annuity oi ten
pounds by way ol alms( Then‚ instead os the annuity, he
granted them the vill os Chesterton for ever, reserving a
rent oi A 30 ol blanched money, which are equivalent to
2631 by tale Confinnations were obtained from Henry 111
and Edward 1. ,

The King had a right to impose upon the manors ol'
his ancient demesne the kind oi tax that was known asa
tallage il he allowed one of those manors to go out of
his own hand by putting a mesne lord over it, nonnally he
lost his right. Thencesorth it was ior that iord to impose
sor his own prolita tallage on that manor when the King
was tallaging the manors that were still in his own hand.

¹ This seems to have been inserted by way oi postscript.
