have in this instance the record (p. 112), the original writ
(p. ιιι), and a bill, scaled by the sheriif, aclrnowledging

that the original writ has been delivered to him. It will
be noticed that our informant has ieapt over some thirty

years in order that he may pursue the history of the
advowson of Burton.

Τ lte Prior v. Robert de Brakenberwe and Rafolr de
if'yklram (pp. 112—4). Assize of darein presentment con-
oerning the same church. The impediente make default.
The jurors of the assize find for the Prior, who has
judgment and a writ to the bishop. Aiso he recovers
damages according to Stat. Westm. 11. c. 5. Besides the
record (p. 114) we see three writs which constitute part of

repiies that, notwithstanding the charter‚ his grandfather
died seised. This issue is tried by the witness named in
the charter and twelve jurors. As to eight acres they
find for the demandant, and as to the residue for the Prior.
Judgment is given accordingly. The parts of this record
have been inverted. We ought to read §2743 before
§26 One of the writs constituting the ‘jury process' is
given in ς 25. It isa venire factos sirm altos.

Mabel wrilow of Thomas Τ uylet v. Τ he Prior (p. 118)
Action of dower. The Prior has vouched Robert son of
Robert Hubert. The sheriff has been ordered to summon

the vouchee but has not done so. The order is repeated. ’

We iearn no more.

T he Prior v. John de Burdeloy (pp. 118-9). Writ for
admeasurement of pasture in Madingley. We have the
original writ to the sheriff, and then the ‘extent' that is
made by jurors at Madingley; but we see no further pro-
