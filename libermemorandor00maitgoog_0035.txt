during a part of every year were commonable Also it had
pastore land which was never inclosed or enjoyed in
severalty‚ ‘the green commons of the town’; for the more
part they are green and open still. But further, so lateas
the reign of James 1, Cambridge, its fields and its green
commons can upon occasion be treated as an agrarian
whole. In 1624 the vice-chancellor of the University and
tbe Mayor of the Borough issued an ordinance touching
the commons of the town. Every occupier of an ancient
tenement having of old time broad gates may turn out two
head of cattle. Every occupier of other tenements and
cottages may turn out one. Every person having six
score acres of land in Cambridge held may tum out six,
and so in proportion for any greater or less quantity of
land¹.

“ Observe what this reverend Vice-Chancellor and this
worshipful Mayor are doing. They seem to be legislating
for an agrarian commonwealth. They are decreeing that
the pasture of the town must still subserve the arable of
the town. And·what is the unit of arable that gives the
normal share of pastum-right? It is six score acres, a
long hundred of acres, a hide².''

The peculiar configuration of the town of Cambridge-
an ellipse with its major diameter north and south, and
the river Cam flowing along its western side—divides the
adjacent fields into two groups‚ eastern and western. I
shall take the former group first, but, before the relations
of these fields to one another are discussed, l must ask my
readers to dismiss all ideas derived from the Cambridge of

today. My object is to reproduce the fields as they were
when the town was in the condition Ι have been trying tu
describe, and when, as Professor Maitland has said, “if a
burgess of Cambridge crossed the ditch, he came out at

once, or almost at once, upon the great sheet of ploughed
land⁸.''
