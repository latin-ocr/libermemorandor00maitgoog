xlvi Introduction

Peverels to the Pecches. Then we read how Gilbert
recent conveyed it to Edward I and his wife Eleanor (p. 51).
The conveyance was made by a ‘fine ’-that is, a ‘final
concord ’—levied in the Court of Common Pleas (coram
iusticiariis domini Reges in banco). Thereupon, as was
customary when a seignory was being transferred by fine,
the tenant of the land-in this case the Prior—was sum·
moned by a weit, known as per quae servicia, to say by
what services he was holding and to attom himself to his
new lord. Here we have an extract from a plea roll (p. 52).
The Prior said that his tenure was frankalmoin, and there-
upon he attorned himself and did fealty to the King and
Queen. Incidentally he secured an acknowledgement by
the King that the seignorial right of patr-onage over the
’ Priory was defined and limited by a deod executed by
Gilbert Pecche in 1256 (p. 49).

Our memorialist says that he does not know why
Gilbert transferred the greater part of his barony to the
King and Queen. The story, however, seems fairly plain.
Gilbert had by his first wife two sons, to whom he greatly
preferred the children of a second wife. He desired there-
fore to leave but little to descend to his heir. King Edward,
as may be seen in other cases, was interested in breaking
up the great baronies and was willing to give money or life
estates in return for fee simple. We shall see below (p. 86)
how he grants to Gilbert Peccht for his life—only for his
life-the rent of ,631 due from the Prior in respect of the
manor of Chesterton. Elsewhere we may see Gilbert con·
veying a Kentish manor to the King and Queen in con·
sideration of a thousand marks1. If he was bent on
‘realising,' as we say, his heritable rights, Edward 1 had
good cause for helping him to do so.

1 may remark, by the way, that I venture to print his
family name as Pecclzl. On the older Latin records it
appears as Peccatuma Perhaps the faithful canons of
Barnwell were ‘prepared to deny with regard to the same
