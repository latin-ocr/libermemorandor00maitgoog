xxiv Introduction

Orchards and little crolts Professor Maitland might
have added gardens to this enumeration; for a glance at
the plans of college sites given in T Ire Archelaum!
Hirtory will shew how many gardens there were in what we
should now call the centn: ol the town; and a similar
result will be attained by a study os the large birds-eye
view os Cambridge made by John Harnond, and dated

considering, asomhri there were such in ¹²79
