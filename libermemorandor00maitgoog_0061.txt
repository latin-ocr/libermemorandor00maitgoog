doweress. This doweress is summoned to courtby aquid
iurr's clamat and attorns to the Prior. All this is lrom the
record. Then we learn that the Prior had to pay six marks
ior the release, but obtained this sum irorn John of Girton.
Maud wr'riow of Edward le carzere v. The Prior
(pp. 154-5). Writ ol' entry ior a tenement in Barnwell,
dismissed ior want oi prosecution. The briei extract from
the roll is iollowed by a story which tells us why Maud
abandoned heraclion. For the understanding of that story
it should be observed that a ‘part’ ol every fine which is
levied in the King's Court is preserved by the Court3 it is

Roger Barbedor v. Tae Prior (pp. 156-7). Assize ol
mort d'ancestor on the death ol the plaintiil's father ior land
in Hinxton. The Prior pleads that the ancestor did not
die seised in see, being but a tenant ior lile by the Prior’s
demise, and also that the plaintill' has an elder brother
living, namely, William. The plaintiff replies that William
cannot inherit as he is professed in religion. The jurors
tell a very curious story about William. He first became
a carmelite iriar at Cambridge, and then became a Cister-
