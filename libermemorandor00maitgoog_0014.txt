imprisonment of John of Balliol in the Tower, 1 Aug. 1296
(p. 237). With this event the book terminares. The text
was originally succeeded by three blank leaves, evidently
intended for future matters of interest, should such occur,
but which are now occupied by documents in a later hand.
We may conclude, therefore, that the work was begun in
1295, and completod in July or August, 1296. The writer
of the MS. was evidently not the author, for there are
numerous clerical errors—-words omitted in the text and
inserted in the margin-words written twice—and occasion·
ally curious misspellings, as though the scribe did not
understand latin, or only imperfectly.

This manuscript is the principal authority for the
history of the Augustinian Priory at Barnwell, near Carn-
bridge. lt has been often quoted, and is usually referred
to as “The Barnwell Cartulary,'’ “The Barnwell Register,’'

or, “The Barnwell Ledger Book.'’ These titles are all
more or less rnisleading, and it is better to adopt the
author’s own title: Liber memorandorum ecclesie de Bem-
welle‚ that is, “The book of those things relating to the
church of Barnwell which are worthy of recollection.”' On
this point l will translate a few lines fronr his prologue

(n- 37l=

Wherefore, in order that the servants of God may the rnone
readily, by the help of God Almigbty, escape out of the hands of
wicked men, having regard to the fact that human memory is
defective, it is worth while to reduce to writing certain things which
may be useful to our church, and by inspection of this little book, may
help our brethren, both present and to corne, when difficulties arise,
and they arc persecuted by a cnrel world. May the Grace of the
Holy Spirit therefore lend his aid to bring this work to a suitable
conclusion.

The contents of the eight books into which the work is
divided are by no means confined to documents relating to
property, or to benehts conferred by Popes, Kings, Bishops,
and benefactors in general 3 nor are daily or yearly events
