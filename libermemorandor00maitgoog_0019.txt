his chuclrle at the escape ol the Prior’s woodcutter, who
proved a convenient alibi in the matter ol a murder, “the
Prior having been caresul on behall ol himself and his
friends with the coroner, who got together a good panel ”

lt will be hardly necessary to attempt a sketch ol the
general history ol Bamwell Priory, or even ol the archi-
tectural history of the church and buildings, sor I have
intentionally made the Chronological Summary so lull that
it will be easy to find in it any event or series ol events
that may be required. On the other hand it is necessary
to state carefully my reasons sor placing the Priors as 1
have done, for our author’s besetting infirmity, a disregard Ι
ol dates, is responsible sor a good deal ol confusion with
regard to them.

No certain date occurs until we reach the account ol
William of Devon‚ sixth Prior, from whom we must first

work backwards, and then sorwards again. We read ol him
that

he would have done much good in temporal as well asin spiritual
matters, ir the Lord had granted him a tranquil life; but, during his
tenure ol office, the whole of England and Wales was under a general

interdict...He died in the year ol our Lord 1213, and ln the sixth year
of the interdict ¹.

As this interdict began 23 March, 1208, part ol the year
1213 would sall within the sixth year os its duration, as
stated above William οἱ Devon was elected in the first
year os the interdict, 1208, il Ι am right in taking “tempore
ejus ” to mean his tenure ol' office, and the whole sentence
to signify that the said tenure and the interdict began
together; and he died 25 May, 1213¹.

¹ Book 1. Ch. 44, p. 67.
¹ The precise date ol' his death is given in the account os his successor, Ib.
