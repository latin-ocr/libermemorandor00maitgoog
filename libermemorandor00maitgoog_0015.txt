recorded after the manner of a Register. On the contrary,
matters of the most varied nature and interest are set down
as they cameto hand, without any attempt at chrono-
logical order. This practice of our author causes
considerable difficulty to those who are in search of a
particular document, or who wish to extract from his pages
acontinuous history of the House. He has prefixed to
the whole work a table of contents, but it is merely a list .
of the rubrics to the chapters, and gives no dates. Ι have
therefore constructed a chronological summary (printed at

tation by the late Professor Maitland (as l have mentioned
in the Preface) in which they are discussed and explained
with even more than his usual clearness and vivacity. He

of the first three books, which those who wish to under·
stand them thoroughly should refer to as they read.
Each case, if of sufficient importance to call for comment,
receives just the amount of elucidation required to dissolve
the mist of legal technicalities, and to set forth its relation
to the history of the Priory or to the law of the kingdom, in
language which all can understand.

The First Book opens with an account of the foundation
of the House, which excites a hope that a detailed history
