might have been very interesting. Seemingly the Univer-
sity had no other base forits claim than its own ‘statutes '
and customs.’

Alan de Frestone v. T he Prior (pp. 185—7). Action in
the Court of Common Pleas ior the arrears oi an annuity
granted by deed to endure l'or so long as the plaintiii'
should serve the Priory as its advocate. The Prior pleads
that the plaintiff has refused his services and a specific
instance oi such refusal is alleged. In reply the plaintiff
denies the reiusal. The Prior joins issue (et Prior
miliur); anda venire sacrus ior jurors is awarded. The
sections (ᾖ 121—2) taken from the record should be read
before the writ (5 120) which is the venire facias issued
aiter the joinder oi issue. We are then told that the Prior
thought it well to make peace at the eost oi ἐπὶ. Α
passage, which may at first sight seem obscure, is to be

interest in the success os a plaintill', because they are
establishing a customary right to take a considerable share
oi any damages that are recovered. As it is, five marks
out oi the Prior’s ἦ 12 go to them.

A writ anda short extract from a roll (pp. 18 5—6) shew
us the Prior acquitted by a jury in an action oi conspiracy
brought by one John Lewyn; but wherein the alleged
conspiracy consisted we do not see.

The Third Book ends with a writ declaring that the
men os Chesterton, which, as already said, is part os the
ancient demesne of the Crown, need not contribule when,
as happens from time to time, an amercement is imposed
upon the county of Cambridge (pp. 188-9). As a counter·
poise ior their liability to tallage, the men oi the ancient
demesne enjoy this immunity from ‘common amercements.'

The Fourth Book contains but little that relates to liti·
gation in the temporal courts. lt is filled chiefly with
events that take place between the years 1290 and 1296.
‘The taxation oi Pope Nicholas’ in 1291 seems to have
suggested the retrospect oi earlier ‘taxations’ with which
the Book begins. Various letters oi proxy are then inserted;
