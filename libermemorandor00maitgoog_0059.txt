Exchequer of the Jews with a debt due by Roget Giffard;
The Prior seems to have acquired some lands which are
burdened with this debt, and the debt-as often happens
with debts originally owed to Jews-has become due to the

identify the lands that were burdened.

Peter de Chaveut v. T lte Prior (pp. 138-9). Aetion of
replevin removed by pone into the Bench. The verdict and

assize gave a surprisingly good verdict for the Prior-‘ dixit
