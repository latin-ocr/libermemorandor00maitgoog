clustered round it¹.'' Adjoining the Market Place our visitor
would see the church os S. Mary the Great, with houses
built up against it, and no open space in front oi it ; but it
must be remembered that that church was very different in
the thirteenth century from the stately building os the
present day, which was not begun till near the end os the
fifteenth century.

To leave the Market Place our visitor could choose
between Shoemaker Row, now Market Street‚ and Petty
Cury, which keeps its curious old name, over the meaning
os which so much discussion has arisen. In the period
which 1 am trying to describe it must have been a singularly
picturesque street, full of movement, soron the south side ol
it there were at least three well-known inns, the Li0n‚ the
Falcon. and the Wrestlers; to take the order in which they
would be approached from the Market Place. At the end
os Petty Cury our visitor would find himself at the south·
east corner os the town; and, is he turned slightly to the
right, as far as Bamwell Gate, then probably a real gate, he
would catch a glimpse ol the cultivated fields stretching
away as lar as the eye could see; and in the soreground the
parish church of S. Andrew, with the Dominican Friary
beyond. From this point he would turn to the lest, and
walk up Bridge Street. Passing on the leit Trinity Church,
then a very small building, he would soon reach the
Franciscan House at the corner os S. Rhadegund's Lane.
Tuming into this lane, and crossing the bridge over the
King’s Ditch‚ he would see on his leit the boundary walls
ol the nunnery os S. Rhadegund founded 1133. Alter
passing this, as he pursued his way to Bamwell Priory, he
would have on his left the Green croit, an open space
os pastore, on part of which, nearest to the Causeway‚ the
Fair called Midsummer Fair was held (p. 87 note), and on
his right Bradmoor Field‚ partos the arable field. At the
Priory, round which there was a small suburb, he would
find that the Canons did not lorget to entertain strangers¹.
