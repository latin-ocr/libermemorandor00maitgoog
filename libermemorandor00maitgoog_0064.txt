is given us, and the verdict of an inquest (ξ 111), and we
are told that judgment went against the Prior. Apparently
the Prior based his claim to immunity on the mere fact
that he had not contributed in the past; but wesee no
pleadings. Less than we might wish has yet been done to
make available for modern studente the valuable materials
that are contained on the plea rolls of the Exchequer.
The story that lies before us is typical of a great mass of
quarrels over the incidence of local imposts

The Prior v. William son os Robert and others (p. 179).
The men of Madingley‚ bent on distraining the Prior for
his contribution, made the mistake of taking his beasts of
the plough. Consequently he brings against thern the
action given by the Statute de Districtione Scaccarii
(51 Hen. ΙΙΙ) The ‘original' writ which refers to this
Statute, is given, but no extract from any record. The
men of Madingley made their peace with the Prior.

The Przbrv. T homasde Bellus, Skenffos Cambridgeslrire
(pp. 180—2). Action of trespass vi et armis for releasing

restore the extorted money (ᾗ 114) is preserved; also the
‘original' writ (§ 115) which, as 'the sherill' is defendant, is
addressed to the coroners. This is an action in the
King's Bench‚ as is shown by the words ‘coram nobis
ubicunque fuerimus in Anglia' which occur instead of
‘coram iusticiariis nostris apud Westmonasterium‚’ the style
of the Common Bench. We hear of pleading, but only
know that aster ‘a loueday had been takem’ peace was
made on the mediation of one of the justices.

The Prior v. Ralplt os Leicester and tlte Chaucellor os the
University (pp. 182—4). Assize of novel disseisin. The
parties plead to issue. An order is given that the assizc be
taken (oleo capiatur assisa), but before the recognitors come
to give a verdict, the parties make peace The record is
set forth at length. The dispute arises out of the strange
right of the University to compel the towns-folk tolet
lodgings ata taxed rate. A verdict about this matter
