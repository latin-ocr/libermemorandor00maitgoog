lii Introduction

There is no law-suit here. We have an inquest taken
ex offinb for the ascertainment of royal rights.

Τ lu Prior v. Richard de Capella and T he Prior v.
Humpltrey de Cloptone and others (pp. 106—8). Two assizes
of novel disseisin. The first is taken upon the default of

the defendant; the jurors fmd a disseisin and the Prior
recovers. In the second the defendants confess the dis-
seisin and the Prior recovers. In addition to the record

of these two assizes, we have the two original writs and
also the ‘patent of assize’ appointing justices to take
these two assizes. The record begins with the formula,
Assysa uenit recognitum (p. 107).

Rapa de Camoys ond ruffe v. Τ he Prior aad Otho son of
William (pp. 108-110). -Assize of darein presentment
conceming the church of Burton. The plaintiff says that
the last parson was presented by his great-great·grand-
mother. The Prior says that a predecessor of his was
the presentor. Otho says that his grandmother was the
presentor. The jurors of the assize find for the Prior. He
has judgment and a writ to the bishop. All this matter

seems to be transcribed from the record. Then a writ is
also transcribed; it is the distringas iuratores (p. 110).

This assize, like other assises of darein presentment, is
taken before the Bench at Westminster, and not before
justices of assize.

1t next appears that, despite this victory in a purely
possessory action, the Prior and his presentee had to make
peace with Ralph de Camoys and his wife, promising them
twenty marks in return for a release of any right they
might have in the advowson. This transaction was effected
before justices in eyre at Lincoln. The account of it
(pp. 110-1) seems to come from the rolls of those

justices,

T ke Prior v. Reum de Brakenberwe (p. 112). Assize of
darein presentment concerning the church of Burton.
The impedient pleads joint tenure with Ralph de Wykham
of a manor to which the advowson is appendant The
writ is abated because of the non-joinder of Ralph We
