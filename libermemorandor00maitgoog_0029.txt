formed a part was of considerable extent, and in form
roughly triangular. The two sides were formed by Bridge
Street and High Street respectively, and the base by
Shoemalrer Row—now Market Street. Another choreb,
that of S. Michael, stood near its southwest comer; but,
with the exception of this church and that of Α11 Saints
previously recorded, it was made up of dwelling-houses and
their gardens. Many centuries were to elapse before it was

later was to contain Michael House, and soon afterwards to
give access to King’s 1-1011. This Lane would offer 00
