small bridge, and thence by a larger bridge into the fields
beyond. Here was Henny or Heneye (p. 289) a mysterious
name which 1 cannot explain ; but the locality was thought
important enough to have a lane alf to itself. Milne Street,
¹which we will suppose our stranger to follow, led, as its
name imports, to the Mills‚ namely the Kings’ Mill and the
Bishop’s Mill on coe Fen. It must therefore have been
a busy, and at times acrowded, thoroughfare. It contained
. the church of S. John Baptist. often mentioned in the
Memoranda, and the House of the carmelites (p. 211).
Between the church and the friary were three lanes, Water

Lane, Salthithe Lane or Strawey Lane (pp. 284, 289), and
lastly Chollcs Laue (p. 289), which, by the help of S. Austin's

space were named after the wares sold in thern, as oat·

S. Edward’s church, which is described in the Memoranda

(p. 287) as situated in ic In those days Peas Hill ·

was connected with the Market Place proper by a short
street, the west side of which consisted of houses abutting
against the east end of S. Edward's Church. The Market
Place propensu f.·shaped area, “contained all the principal
buildings, the Cross, the Tolbooth or Guildhall, the prison,
the fountain, and also the stocks and the pillory. The
principal inns looked on to it, or were close to it, and the
