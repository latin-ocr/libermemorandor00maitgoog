xiv Introductrun

Before I pass to other matters Ι should like to say a
lew words on the author 01 the Memoranda. He gives no
hint as to who he was, but it is obvious that he must have
been at least a canon 01 the House, and probably one who
held some high office, 101· inno other way could he have
had access to the documents and private matters with
which he deals. It is probable that 110 based his work
on that oi a previous historiar, lor, when he is telling the
story 01 Prior Domesman's generosity in giving his father's
land to the House (p. 98), 110 says: “so wrote Canon
Guarinus‚’' but he evidently has doubts about his accuracy,
sor 110 adds: “l do not remember to have seen the deod 01
gis .”, That he examined originale is obvious from the
way in which he notes minute particulars-as the colour
01 the wax 01 which a Royal Seal was made, and its
condition. He may have been a student in the
neighbouring University, 101 he was evidently a learned ,
person, who wrote a good style, and was well acquainted
with classical Latin. Whoever he was, the epithets which
110 applies to Prior Gerard (p. 64), when he calls him
pleasant, and very good humoured (jucundus et tyllam
valde), might have been applied with justice to himself.
There is, 01 course, what l may call a professional tone
about a good deal 01 his narrative ; the world is very evil ;
the monastic orders are the objects 01 a cruel persecution;
the hand 01 every man is against them; and almost any
weapon may justifiably be used by them to combat their
enemies But, when allowance has been made sor the
introduction 01 these unavoidable phrases, how even is
the flow ol his narrative; how admirably he describes
an event; what humorous touches he introduces when
occasion allows 01 it. ln· support 01 what l have said let
me cite his description 01 the buming 01 1110 church-tower
(p. 220); his account 01 what befell at Wiggenhall‚ when
Prior Jolan and some 01 his canons were set upon by
thieves, and barely escaped with their lives (pp. 119-121) ;Ι
the evident amusement with which he tells the story 01 the ¹
worn-out horse sent as a present to a great man (p. 126) ;
