alteration which would place the outrage at Wiggenhall
between October, 1266, and October, 1267, and make the
election of Prior Simon take place in 1266, from which
date “thirty years and more'’ hringus without difficulty
to 1297.

The correctness of this view is confirmed by what is
said about the circumstances of his election. We are told
(p. 73) that “the aforesaid Symon assumed the habitos
a canon on the day of the Translation of S. Augustino
(6 September), and on the same day, after ten years had
elapsed, was elected Prior (Pastorl” As he resigned at
Midsummer, 1297, thirty years from that date would bring
us to Midsummer, 1267; but, as he was elected in
September, we may allow him a further tenure of nine
months, which is justified by the words et amplias, and
consider him to have been elected Prior 6 September, 1266.

There is, however, another difficulty, namely, that the
list of tenants in Book vll. was drawn up “ in 1295, and in
the year since Symon de Ascellis became Prior the 31st’'
(p. 282). May we decide that this statement was made
from memory, and is therefore inaccurate?

The following dates may be assigned to the last six
Priors who enter into our narrative:

7. William of Bedsord, 1213.

8. Richard de Burgh, 1213.

9. Laurente de Stanesfeld, 1213—1251.
10. Henry of Eye, 1251-1254

11. Jolan de Thorley, 1255—1266.

12. Symon de Ascellis, 1266-1297.

1v. Tua Town or Cnuanmoa

The town of Cambridge at the end of the thirteenth
century was so very different from the same place at the
present day, that 1 have decided to attempt a brief

description of itas it then appeared, illustrated by a plan
slightly altered from that which was prepared for the
Architectural Hutory.
