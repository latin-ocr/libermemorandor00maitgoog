xlviii , Introduction

However, it appears that King John, aster his grant to the
Priory, twice succeeded in tallaging the men of Chesterton.
On a third occasion they were spared, the deed oi grant
being taken as an answer to the claim. At this point we
have extracts from the Pipe Rolls which contain the accounts
rendered by the sheriffs at the Exchequer (p. 78). Then
in 1241 the Prior succeeds in getting from the King's
Council an admission that, despite those two unlucky prece-
dents, which, it is observed, occurred in the time of the
great Interdict, it is notior the King to tallage the Prior's
men in Chesterton. Then we leam irom a well told story

- how at a later day the King's escheator, himself a rnan os

religion, repeated the old claim, but was iuli willing to take
a bribe, which bribe, however, he did not get, since the
Prior obtained a writ from the Exchequer commanding
him to desist. We observe in passing that the men os
Chesterton are not the gainers by the Prior's victory. He
proceeds to tallage them ‘ior his own proper use'
(rp- 78—82l·

We continue our study ol the rent payable in respectos
Chcsterton. The King granted a part os it, namely 2620,
to one Wiliiam de Hastingtot, to be received by him lrom
the Prior's hand. lt was a grant that was to endure only
until the King should give Wiliiam an equivalent amount
oi land, to wit, twenty librates. Wiliiam died leaving an
iniant heir, and the King proceeded to act as though he, as
guardian in chivalry, could deal with this rent oi 2620
during the heir’s minority. He granted it to one Roger de
Wauton. Then, however, Wiliiam's widow asserted that
she was entitled to part os it as doweress and to the residue
as the heir's guardian in socage. Her claim was successful,
and the Prior was ordered to pay the 2620 to her. These
dealings with the rent are oi interest to the Priory, for it is
ol importance that payments be made only to those who
can give a good discharge. lt will be seen that at one point
the Prior paid to Roger de Wauton έ4. ros. which should
have been paid into the Excheqper, but succeeded in
getting the mistake set right (pp. 84-5). Then, the
