lvi ⁴ Introduction

transcribet has copied this in order that we may see who is
the ‘eadem lsabella' who brings a writ against the Prior.
Rector of S. Androm, Hirton v. Τ ho Prior. Suit in the
court of Rome for the tithes of Histon. This is a very
instructive tale of protracted litigation, but no documents

are set forth. Few modern readers will leam of the rector's
sad end without feeling some of that pity for him which
was far from the mind of the narrator. lndeed we are

Two anecdotes introduce us to the coroner's inquest

an ecclesiastical court before judges delegate for damages
caused to the plaintifs, an ecclesiastic, by the Prior’s refusal '
to ransom him out of the hands of his enemies. The Prior
pays 1610, and so purchases peace. No documents are
given us.

We now pass to the many cases which came before the
justices in eyre at Cambridge in 1286.

Gonnora of Barton and another v. John of Girton
(pp. 152—3). Assize of mort d'ancestor in which the
