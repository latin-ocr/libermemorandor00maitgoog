in monastic annals and monastic cartularies; but the Canons
os Bamwell seem to have been more than ordinarily caresul
in obtaining and preserving them. A large part oi this book
consists of such transcripts.

Let us look at one os them. We will choose rather
a long instance (p. 100). The malrer os this book first tells
