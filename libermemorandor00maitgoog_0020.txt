xvi Introduction

His predecessor Robert‚ fifth Prior, held office for

thirty-three years. He was therefore elected in 1175 ¹.

Hugh Domesman, fourth Prior, died “ in the twentieth
year after he had taken office².'’ He was therefore elected
in 1155.

Richard Norel, third Prior, who resigned “within two
years³,” was therefore elected in 1153.

Of the remaining two Priors we are told that Geoffrey,
first Prior, “ ruled the church for twenty years, and after

their translation to Barnwelle died, full of years, and in
great sanctity⁴.'' As the foundation took place in 1092 we
are obliged to place Geofl'rey's death in 1112, the very year
of the removal to Barnwell. Of the length of time during
which Gerard, second Prior, held office, no word is said3
and we are therefore obliged to assign to him the whole
interval between the death of Geofsrey and the election of
Richard Norel, namely, forty-one years. But, if a longer
time ought to be assigned to William of Devon, Prior Gerard's
time may be shortened. Before we can do that, however,
we must await further information. Until then the suc·
cession and dates of the first six Priors will be as follows:

1. Geoffrey,1092-1112.

2. Gerard,1112—1153.

3. Richard Norel, 1153-1155.

4 Hugh Domesman, 1155-1175.
5. Robert,1175—1208.

6. William of Devon, 1208—1213.

We will next investigate the remaining six Priore.
After the death of William of Devon (25 May, 1213) the
office remained vacant until 23 October, when the sacrist,
William of Bedford. was elected seventh Priorl. He died
almost immediately afterwards, and his successor, Richard
de Burgh‚ eighth Prior, had an equally short tenure of
office‘. -

The canons next elected as ninth Prior Laurence de
Stanslield who had been chaplain to his three predecessors.
