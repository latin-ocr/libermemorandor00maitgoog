standing of it, referring my readers for the rest to his paper,
which well deserves careful study.

At the close of the itineration of the Justices there carne many
king’s briefs of &ro waranto. For, two years previously, the king, by
advice of John de Kirkeby, had begun Cambridge Castle. Whereof, by
the king's precept inquisition was made by free lieges of the county
concerning the Castle bounds, who, having been suoru, made a peram·
bulation of it. Beginning at the place called Arrmswerk they went
round the fossatum of the Castle, ascending as far as the place called
Aswykston, and then descending they passed through the middle of
the curia of the scholars of Merton through the old fossatum as far
as the n'ver. And at last returning they gave answer on their oath that
all this circuit belonged to the Castle bounds. On this occasion came
king's briefs of &ro warranto addressed severally to all who dwelt
beyond the bridge in the Castle quarter. This caused universal alarm.

Mr Gray suggests that Armeswerk was probably “a
barbican on the river bank, protecting the river front of the
castle and the bridge from assault of an enemy proceeding
up stream '’; and he has pointed out to me that the same
word is used in the Chronicle of the monastery at Ely called
Liber Elr'ensis to designate the spot at which the messengers
sent by Sexburga found amarble sarcophagus fit to contain

the body of her sister Etheldreda:

Tbey cameto a small town, then in ruins, at no great distance
[from Ely], called in English Grantecester. And while they were
walking to and fro in much tribulation, they found, at a place which
even to the present day is called Armeswerch, a sarcophagus of white
marble, etc.¹

Mr Gray further shews, on the evidence of a terrier
‚among the muniments of Jesus College which was originally
drawn up in the reign of Edward the Third, the position of
Aswykston :

Ashwyke stone y⁵ by 'yt hie crosse at y⁸ Castle end, south weste of
ye stone crosse, as it were a quayste cast of, hentiugedon waye
betwixt, and is nowe a bill, and once stood yer on a lyttle stomped
crosse

“A quoit throw,'’ adds Mr Gray, “is usually considered
to be 19 yards. Aswykston stood at this distance S.W. of
