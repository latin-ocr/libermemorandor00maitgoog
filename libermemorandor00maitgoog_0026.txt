xxii Introduction

Il our stranger looked down stream he would catch

· adistant glimpse of one of the most important of the

CommonS, Greencroft, of which more below; and about 150
yards below the Bridge he would see the King's Ditch
opening into the river. This ditch, a very important
boundary in the Mlddle Ages, as it marked the limit
of what Professor Maitland calls “the urban nucleuS,” will
be fully described below, as well as the Fields which lay
beyond it.

The view up stream would be more interesting, and
even from that point would give some idea of the im-
portance of the River Cam in those days as a highway‚
along which fuel and provender of all sorts were brought to
= Cambridge. Close to the Bridge, on the left bank, was
probably the wharf which still exists under the name
of Fisher Laoc, and beyond, if Ι am right in supposing
that the houses near the river were of insignificant siae,
he might catch a glimpse of Cornhythe, otherwise Deme
Nichol’s Hythe (p. 289). This must have been a specially
important wharf, for it had a lane all to itself opening out ,
of High Street, called afterwards King's Hall Lane, but in
earlier days the road to Dame Nichol's Hythe. The plan
shews other hythes-as for instance Flaxhythe and
Salthythe—names which indicate that each commodity had
its own wharf.

From the Bridge a visitor who looked up stream would
also get a view across part of the arable ground, the
Western Fields of Cambridge lt is possible that in the
thirteenth century some portion ol these Fields, that
for instance nearest to the River, had been turned into
pastore, but, before hedgerows had come into being, and
the cornhelds basked in sunshine unbroken by rows of
trees, it would be possible to see from the Great Bridge
’ a long stretch of open land with its strips belonging
to different owners, and therefore cultivated with a
considerable variety both of produce and of method.

From the Bridge would also be visible the fish-ponds
which in those days belonged to S. John’s Hospital, and
